<H1> <p>Mini Lop Bunnie</p> </H1>
   


<p>Mini lop Bunnies are relatively new rabbit breeds and have only been available in Australia since 1998. The term “Lop” is from the characteristic ears of this rabbit, which are long and wide and hang either side of the head, touching the ground. They are very cute creatures, and are great as family pets.</p>

        <br> <H1><p>Bunnie Diet</p> </H1>
        <br><p>Bunnies eat a varity of things. Vegetables such as cauliflower, parsley, spinach, corn on the cob and carrots, can be offered weekly. Lettuce is not a good option for rabbits, because there is a high level of calcium. Hay and straw should be provided daily. They also eat many different brands of pellets, such as timothy hay pellets.</p>

        <H1> <p>Bunnie Toys</p> </H1>

        <br> <p>Bunnies need a lot of attention. Objects to manipulate or throw, bunnies will enjoy. Untreated straw, wicker, sea-grass mats and baskets, balls and plastic flower pots are also very suitable for bunnies. Solid plastic baby toys such as key rings, rattles, stacking cups, and some robust cat and parrot toys can also make good rabbit toys.</p>
